# Project Assumnption & Use of Time Illustration
For the purpose of deriving any assumptions or how long I took on each section of the assignment i've detailed this below.

## Assumptions:
* For completeness the programming assignment part should marry up with the QA strategy & Test Plan.
* Given we cannot use the CultureAi extension we must use another or create our own for greater control.
* You can hand in the project at least 24 hours before your interview start time i.e. if your interview in on Monday you can hand in at the latest (Sunday at 1pm).

### Create a QA Strategy document 1-2 pages Outlining: 
* Your Overall Approach. **(10 Minutes)**
* Types of Testing You Would Implement **(10 minutes)**
* Key Risk Areas & How You Would Address Them. **(10 minutes)**
* Approach To Balancing Manual VS Automated Testing. **(10 minutes)**
* Polishing The Document For Members of SLT. **(20 minutes)**

#### Develop A Test Plan That Includes:
* A List Of Atleast 5 Critical Test Scenarios **(10 minutes)**
* Prioritisation Of Test Cases. **(10 minutes)**
* Approach to Regression Testing. **(10 minutes)**
* Polishing The Documents For Members of SLT. **(20 minutes)**

#### Soft Skill Time Summary: **(Total 1 Hour & 50 Minutes)**

### Programming Assignment: Implement Automated Browser Extension Tests
* Writing a decent README.md **(30 minutes)**
* Learn to build Extensions from Scratch **(30 minutes)**
* Learn how to write a playwright test to access an extension **(30 minutes)**
* Write tests that demonstrate test diversity
  - Feature Based With The Developer Extension Code **(30 mins)**
  - Security Based With The Developer Extension Code **(30 mins)**
* Refactoring Code For Readability & Easily Maintainable Design **(30 mins)**

#### Programming Skill Time Summary **(2 hours 30 minutes)**
#### Total Time Taken: **(4 hours 50 minutes)**
